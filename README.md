In this project, we’ll teach you making a wireless power transmission circuit. Wireless Electricity Transfer or WET is a process to supply power through an air gap without using any wires or physical link. It is a useful circuit and you also can use this project circuit as like power supply and a induction stove circuit.

In this wireless system, the transmitter device generates a time-varying or high-frequency electromagnetic field, which transmits power to receiver device without any physical connection.

In this project, we will build a basic low powered wireless transmitter circuit to glow an LED or 3 watt filament bulb.

Component List - 

To make this wireless power transfer circuit, we might need some electronics component.

All components list have been given below –

•	Mosfet – IRF 250 N

•	Diode – 1N 5399 *2

•	Resistor –  220 Ω, 10 KΩ

•	Metallized Polypropylene Film Capacitor – 105J 400v *4

•	Toroidal Coil 

•	Output Sockets

Mosfet Pin Out - 

The metal–oxide–semiconductor field-effect transistor, also known as the metal–oxide–silicon transistor, is a type of insulated-gate field-effect transistor that is fabricated by the controlled oxidation of a semiconductor, typically silicon. 

Its 3 legs pin-out can be seen above.

•	Gate

•	Drain

•	Source

Feature - 

•	Simple design

•	Lower frequency operation

•	Low cost

•	Practical for short distance

Circuit Connection – Step 1

To make this wireless power transmission circuit, 1st we connect one mosfet “source” leg with another mosfet “source” leg. Then we make a parallel connection in these Metallized Polypropylene Film Capacitor. 

Now we connect both 220 Ω resistor one side terminal with toroidal coil, and then connect it’s other two terminal with “Gate” leg of mosfet.

Then we connect rectifier diode with the circuit. We connect rectifier diode negative terminal with “Drain” leg of mosfet and rectifier diode positive terminal with “Gate” leg of mosfet. We follow the same method connection for another rectifier diode also.

We utilize JLCPCB https://jlcpcb.com/RTA to printout our PCB.

Circuit Connection – Step 2

To make this circuit, we used a hand made toroidal coil. It’s have three terminal. Two side have (zero) 0 turns and 1 side have 80 turns. We connect it’s 0 (zero) turns terminal with both mosfet “Drain” leg and it’s 80 turns leg with 220Ω resistor. 

Now we connect 10K resistor with the circuit. We connect this two resistor with both  mosfet “Gate” and “Source” leg.

Circuit Connection – Step 3

For wireless transmission, now we make a coil. Copper wire gauge would be 47mm and there would be 6 turns. We connect this coil two terminal with two mosfet “Drain” leg.

Now we just need to connect DC-12v power supply circuit. We connect its positive leg with toroidal coil 80 turns socket and it’s negative leg with “Source” leg of mosfet.

Thanks to JLCPCB for offering us, this SMT PCB circuit.
